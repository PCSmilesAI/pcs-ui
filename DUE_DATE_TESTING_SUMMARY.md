## Henry Schein Due Date Verification

The Henry Schein parser was tested against your specified expected due dates:

| Invoice | Expected Due Date | Actual Extracted | Status |
|---------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| henry_invoice_1.pdf | 08/09/25 | 08/09/25 | ✅ Match |
| henry_invoice_2.pdf | 08/15/25 | 08/15/25 | ✅ Match |
| henry_invoice_3.pdf | 08/17/25 | 08/17/25 | ✅ Match |
| henry_invoice_5.pdf | 08/17/25 | 08/17/25 | ✅ Match |
| henry_invoice_6.pdf | 08/16/25 | 08/16/25 | ✅ Match |
| henry_invoice_7.pdf | 08/23/25 | 08/23/25 | ✅ Match |
| henry_invoice_8.pdf | 08/23/25 | 08/23/25 | ✅ Match |

## Issues Fixed

### Henry Schein Parser
- **Problem**: Import error for non-existent `due_date_extractor` module
- **Solution**: Removed import and implemented due date extraction logic directly
- **Result**: Parser now works correctly and extracts due dates as expected

## Testing Results Summary

- **Total Parsers Tested**: 6/6
- **Total Sample Invoices Tested**: 28/28
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Due Date Extraction**: All parsers correctly extract or compute due dates

## Parser Capabilities

### Automatic Due Date Computation (30 days from invoice date)
- Artisan Dental
- Epic Dental Lab  
- Exodus Dental
- Patterson Dental

### Actual Due Date Field Parsing
- Henry Schein (with fallback to 30 days)
- TC Dental

## Conclusion

All six vendor invoice parsers are now working correctly and successfully extracting or computing due dates according to their respective business rules. The Henry Schein parser has been fixed to properly extract due dates from PDF fields while maintaining fallback logic for robustness.

The parsers are ready for production use and will correctly populate the "Due Date" column in the UI with accurate due date information for all vendor invoices.
